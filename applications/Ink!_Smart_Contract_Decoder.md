### Overview

Automated Ink! smart contract decoder using SubSquid

In order to facilitate growth in Ink! and Substrate ecosystems, parachains using both of these technologies need a vast and thriving environment of developers creatings dApps and smart contracts. Each new growing dApp, with its own marketing & growth strategy, **brings in new active users to the ecosystem**. Each smart contract generates thousands of transactions that store important technical and business insights. These insights are currently hard to discover and the ecosystem needs infrastructure tools that would make it easy for developers and management teams to uncover them, similarly as it is done in EVM environment with tools like Tenderly or Dune Analytics.

Tokenguard is an on-chain growth analytics tool dedicated for Substrate based blockchains & dApps. With its no-code and no-SQL approach, Tokenguard provides access to core and advanced metrics with user-friendly & easy-to-use dashboards. It is a fully customizable tool that allows to add and change desired metrics and tracking data. Additionally, with its real-time chain monitoring feature, Tokenguard helps strengthen chain security by setting alert notifications for events such as rugpulls, hacks, or other abnormal behaviours.

Main features:

 - Ecosystem Analytics - dashboards with off and on-chain metrics that allow to get insights about ecosystem growth and marketing strategies efficiency.
 - Advanced Analytics:
	 - dApps Analytics – dashboard with off & on-chain metrics for individual dApps. This feature allows to track inflow of new users into the ecosystem from specific dApps.
	 - Security Monitoring – real-time on-chain monitoring tool allowing to set-up security rules for abnormal activity and receive notifications to the Pendulum team.

### Substrate Ecosystem Impact

Tokenguard simplifies the management of blockchain data, providing quick and easy access to information for informed business decisions. As an analytical tool, it provides insights necessary for the functioning and growth of both the community and the Core team:
-   Transparency & Credibility
    -   access to data and on-chain insights is the basis for a community driven blockchain
    -   the ability to track and verify activity and growth in the Polkadot networks reinforces trust
-   Investment
    -   a tool that gives access to the performance of individual dApps and DeFi allows for a better assessment of the market situation in terms of investment
    -   insight into data on developer activity and TVL allows to attract additional additional community members who want to invest in Vara and its ecosystem
-   Engagement
    -   a well-informed community is more likely to be involved in the building programs on a given chain and in ongoing activities
    -   access to insights allows the community to actively promote chain in social media, at events and in ordinary media
      
### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

In order to enable smart contracts analytics for Ink! builders, there needs to be a solution allowing infrastructure apps such as Tokenguard, Polkaholic and others decode on-chain contract activity. Currently there's no solution that would allow indexing on-chain data from Ink! smart contracts into normalized data available for parsing and presenting insights to dApp builders & creators in Ink!.

As an effect, most of Ink! teams that we spoke with **are wasting hundreds of hours and thousands of $** to build their own indexing solutions and maintain them which effectively defocuses them from building and developing user-centric features. Most of these solutions are hard to maintain and manage, increasing the technological debt of each project.

Tokenguard proposes to create a universal smart contract decoding solution based on SubSquid technology which currently **offers the most flawless indexing experience that could be used by any Ink! builder out there**. The code can also be used by analytics tools created in the space. 

Benefits of the proposed solution:

- Allowing Ink! dApp builders focus on **developing their products**
- **Time and money savings** on creating in-house smart contract indexers
- Smaller maintenance cost and technological debt
- **Faster growth of Ink! dApps**
- More developer-friendly ecosystem in comparison to EVM which has numerous contract-indexing solutions

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | MIT |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can index, decode and vizualize any smart contract written in INK. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Manual & article | We will publish an article that explains deliverables and how to use them. We will explain how the universal data model is designed, allowing for efficient indexing and decoding of smart contracts and their storage in the database. In addition, we will explain how to use contract agnostic squid and how to index and decode smart contracts written in Ink! to obtain data on which functionalities are used, by whom and how often. Finally, we will describe how the GraphQL interface was created, the purpose of which is to visualize indexed data in the form of charts and numbers. |
| 1. | Contract-agnostic Squid | Using SubSquid ecosystem we will prepare contract-agnostic squid which indexes normalized data about contract from provided ABI. The code will be delivered as an open-source repository on Github. |
| 2. | GraphQL interface | We will prepare GraphQL access interface to indexed data for builders usage. |


...


## Future Plans

After creating this contract-agnostic template we will follow with another grant to prepare a tool for Ink! builders to transform data into useful insights.
