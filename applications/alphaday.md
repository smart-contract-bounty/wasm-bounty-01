## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.

We help solve the issue of information fragmentation and aim to serve as a central point where any user (whether they are a developer, enthusiast, investor) can instantly get the Ink!ubator related information they need, stay up to date on the latest videos & podcasts and much more.

Alphaday is and will remain to be free-to-use for end users.

### ink! Ecosystem Impact

We aim to create a dashboard that serves users, holders, developers, VC’s and stakeholders of projects that support ink! smart contract deployment; particularly those already in production: Aleph Zero, Astar Network, Shiden, Phala, Pendulum, Amplitude, Turnoa and Krest.

The dashboard will include an amalgamation of relevant information extracted from official sources into one customizable dashboard. Alphaday automated data importations includes forums, blogs, reddit, discord, news sources, token market prices, videos, podcasts, DAO votes, and more. We use RSS feeds and APIs to automate data importation. In addition to automated data importation, we create and regularly maintain manually imported data such as: events, documentation (ink! documentation), developer tools (grants & bounties, tutorials, and other resources), link directories, ecosystem projects, and more.

In general, users who can track their favorite projects more easily, stay engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention. Alphaday can also be used as an onboarding tool for newcomers since it aggregates all relevant project-specific data into one dashboard for visibility and ease of access.

### Project Details

- We’ve conducted market research on users and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow social feeds, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available on Alphaday.

- We are aiming to be the de facto homepage for all crypto users. People using Alphaday to stay up to date with their favourite crypto projects, listen to podcasts, do research, participate in discussions and much more. Other competitors are all competing within much narrower niches. We get their services and integrate them into our app so users don’t have to jump from one service to another, it's all available on Alphaday.

- Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

- Data importation is automated through RSS feeds and APIs.

- Our challenges revolve mostly around:
1. Changes in API or RSI feeds that need to be updated on a regular basis
2. News sources or other content sources that need to be added or removed
3. Manual importation of data, such as upcoming events, that are not picked up by the Alphaday aggregator engine.
4. New developments or integrations, and quality assurance/testing of new features and widgets.

## Future Plans

If we get a grant we will start working on the board immediately and we should have it ready within 2 months. Once we’ve launched the board, we use forums and other channels available to gather feedback and tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that ink! stakeholders truly love to use.

We have just recently released a new mobile app version of Alphaday. The dashboard will be available on the desktop version, and we will adapt the new mobile app to automatically filter the ‘superfeed’ based on each project’s url; e.g. ‘/b/Inkubator’ would direct users to the alphaday superfeed page and automatically filter it for all relevant projects.

Other future plans include further development of the app as a whole, and adding new features and functionalities. We have also started focusing on marketing more this year to boost the value our partners get from us, as well as to increase awareness of Alphaday.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Bounty Program?** 
https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/grants

We do not have direct competitors who are competing in the experience aggregator space but our individual widgets do overlap with features offered by Dune, Nansen, Zapper/Zerion, Coingecko, Discord, DeFiLama, Snapshot.

Bear in mind that the above are feeding data to Alphaday itself.

We are aiming to be the de facto homepage for all crypto users. People using Alphaday to stay up to date with their favourite crypto projects, listen to podcasts, do research, participate in discussions and much more. Other competitors are all competing within much narrower niches. We get their services and integrate them into our app so users don’t have to jump from one service to another, it's all available on Alphaday.

Established partners: Aave, Chiliz, TheGraph, Avalanche, Polygon, Sui, Reserve Protocol, Metis, Dfinity, Zcash, XRPL, Ethereum Classic, RocketPool, Starknet and many others.

We are currently working on open sourcing Alphaday completely. This should take place in around 2 weeks.
