## Development Status :open_book:

At the moment, our team is actively engaged in the planning and design stage of the CryptoCreatures project. This idea was taken from the valuable insights gathered from the [Security Review ink! & cargo-contract](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/security-review-ink-cargo-contract) made by Open Zeppelin Team, specifically from the Education recommendations section where they say: "Build an interactive tutorial similar to CryptoZombies to learn how to code in ink!."
CryptoZombies is the largest education platform for blockchain development, it’s been around for 4+ years, with over 400k registered users that have finished multiple courses.

### Milestone 2 - Core Platform

This milestone will provide the creation of the learning platform and will offer three interactive coding lessons for users. This platform is more than just a set of tutorials; it's a dynamic learning environment. With self-paced exercises that come equipped with auto-correction features, users can practice coding at their own speed and receive instant feedback.

As users engage with the lessons and exercises, our backend will assess the accuracy of their code submissions. If mistakes are identified, the system taps into a database of common coding errors related to the lesson and offers hints and relevant documentation. This feedback mechanism is tailored to the specifics of the lesson, expected outcomes, and the difficulty level of the exercise, providing users with a custom and supportive learning journey.

The platform will be engineered with scalability in mind, prepared to accommodate the addition and editing of future lessons. The database design will support this scalability, housing information on lessons, common coding mistakes, and user progress. To ensure user data protection and a personalized experience, we will implement a strategic authentication system. Furthermore, the dedicated code editor will be developed to optimize the user coding experience, while the progress tracking feature will help users to monitor their learning trajectory. Through all these features and functionalities, we aim to offer users an enriching learning experience, instant feedback, and continuous avenues for skill development and mastery.

The deliverables of this milestone not only embody our commitment to creating a dynamic learning environment but also exemplify our dedication to user-centric design and experience.
